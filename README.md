<summary>Description</summary>

Let a language model give early feedback on your PRs automatically.

This step uses the GitHub and OpenAI APIs to review a PR and post a comment with reminders and thought-provoking questions the PR author might have missed.

The comments are generated based on the PR title, description, and a system prompt. The step **does not** access code, only PR metadata (makes you write better PR descriptions üòú).

Limitations:
- bring your own OpenAI API key
- GitHub only
